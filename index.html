        <h2>About Me</h2>

            <p id="bio">
                As a Computer Technology student at NTNU, Class of '28, I've nurtured a fascination with programming that began at the age of 10. My journey started in the video game "Minecraft", where I programmed robots to bypass the game's more mundane tasks. This early exposure to problem-solving through code ignited a lasting love for technology and its potential.
    
                Currently, I serve the student community as an active member of Abakus, my line union. Here, I have learned leadership and team skills. Within the Arrangement Committee, I've not only found a platform to engage and connect with peers but also an opportunity to make a significant impact. I'm particularly proud of orchestrating a charity event that successfully rallied the community and raised over 95 000 kr for Give Directly, a charity that operates out of East Africa.
                
                I am eager to shape a future where my passion for programming translates into positive change.
